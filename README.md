A starter React app with minimal libraries.

You have the essentials:

- Webpack 4 with dev and prod configurations
- WDS + HMR with [React ðŸ”¥ Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)
- [Coding spliting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/)
- The latest React version
- The latest JS features using [babel-preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env)
- [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)

## Commands

This app only has two commands:

`$ npm start`  
Starts the WDS for you, binding to port 3000.

`$ npm run build`  
Builds your app into a `bundle.[chunk].js` bundle in the `public` directory.
